# Facility Management System

## <u>Project Description</u>
As companies evolve and grow, so does their team and office space. 
During a businesses "transition period", our application allows facility management and company logistics to view and allocate their employees and their needs.
The managers are given oversight and are able to move employees to different departments, floors, and office locations as needed.

**AUDIENCE**:
Facility Managers and Logistic Managers

**PROBLEM**:
Managers not being able to accurately assess facility requirements and seating plans during transition periods.

**PRODUCT SOLUTION**:
An application that allows managers to visually comprehend where their employees are stationed. This app also gives managers the tools they need to move employees around floors, departments, and cubicles.

**MVP FEATURES**:
* Which floor departments are on
* Which office space employees are located
* Representation of office space available
    - Ex: '9/12 office space available'

**FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**:
* More buildings can be added
* Employees being in multiple deparments/floors
